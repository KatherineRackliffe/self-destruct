<h2>This Essay Will Self Destruct</h2>

<p>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm</p>

  <p>Few things are as painful as getting a motor stuck in your hair. One day, as I was working on a robot for the First Tech Challenge robotics competition, my long blonde hair dangled too close to the motor, and as the motor spun, it caught my hair quickly and became a tangled mess. One of the boys on the team scoffed at me, muttering something about how girls shouldn’t work on robots. I tried to wear my hair in a ponytail after that.</p>

  <p>In the play R.U.R., is it any coincidence that our sympathetic character voicing her concerns as to the sentience of the robots is a woman?

    “There’s a certain demand for them, you see. Servants, saleswomen, stenographers. People are used to it.”
