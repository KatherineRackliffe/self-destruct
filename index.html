          <p>Few things are as painful as getting a motor stuck in your hair. One day, as I was working on a robot for the First Tech Challenge robotics competition, my long blonde hair dangled too close to the motor, and as the motor spun, it caught my hair quickly and became a tangled mess. One of the boys on the team scoffed at me, muttering something about how girls shouldnâ€™t work on robots. I tried to wear my hair in a ponytail after that.
